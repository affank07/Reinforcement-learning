Implementing Advantage Actor critic (A2C) algorithm using OpenAI GYM and Python and solving multiple RL environments. Successfully training the model on all 3 
environments which are grid environment, Lunar Lander, and OpenAI Ant (OpenAI GYM), and getting the desired evaluation result where the agent is maximizing its 
reward per episode and reaching the goal.

The results are attached in the report.
