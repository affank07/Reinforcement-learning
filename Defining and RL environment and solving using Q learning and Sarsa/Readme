Creating an RL environment using OpenAI GYM and python, successfully creating a deterministic as well as stochastic grid environment with an agent with multiple rewards 
in the grid and a goal.
Solving the RL environments using Q learning and SARSA algorithms, successfully training the model in both the algorithms, and checking by running the agent with the 
learned policy where the agent is successfully achieving maximum reward per episode and reaching the goal.
The results are attached in the report.
